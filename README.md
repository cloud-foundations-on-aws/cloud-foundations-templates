## Cloud Foundations

To support cloud adoption, AWS recommends that you have a foundational set of capabilities that enable you to deploy, operate, and govern your workloads. A capability includes a definition, scenarios, guidance, and supporting solutions to establish and operate a specific part of a cloud environment. Capabilities are designed to integrate into your overall technology environment.
