# Foundational Organizational Unit Structure and Accounts

The [foundational-organizational-unit-structure.yml](./foundational-organizational-unit-structure.yml) template deploys a basic AWS Organizational Unit structure with AWS accounts for log centralization and security tooling. By starting with a subset of the [AWS Multi-Account Strategy Recommended OUs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/organizing-your-aws-environment/recommended-ous-and-accounts.html), you will have an organizational structure that allows you to start building out your environment and workloads and allow you to create additional recommended OUs as they are needed.

> **Note:** Deploy the template from your [AWS management account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_getting-started_concepts.html).

The following diagram illustrates the resources deployed by the template foundational-organizational-unit-structure.yml](./foundational-organizational-unit-structure.yml).
