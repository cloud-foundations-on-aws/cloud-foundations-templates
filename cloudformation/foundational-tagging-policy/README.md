# Foundational Tagging Policy

The foundational tagging policy provides a CloudFormation template example of creating an AWS Organization Tagging policy. Leverage the template to customize for you tagging policy solutions.

Reference the CloudFormation documentation for the [AWS::Organizations::Policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-organizations-policy.html) for details on the CloudFormation resource as well as the AWS Organizations documentation on the [Tag Policy syntax examples](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_example-tag-policies.html). Ensure that you review the AWS Organizations documentation on tagging policy [Best practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_tag-policies-best-practices.html).
