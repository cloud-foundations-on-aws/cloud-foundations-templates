        title: Create management account
        description: The management account is the account that will be used to manage your Organization. If you have an existing account that you plan to use as the management account of a Control Tower managed environment, be sure to review the Control Tower pre-launch checks guidance (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/userguide/getting-started-prereqs.html).  In a multi-account environment, the management account is key to all the mentioned administrative tasks such as account management, policies, integration with other AWS services, consolidated billing, and so on. Therefore, you should restrict and limit access to the management account only to those admin users who need rights to make changes to the organization.

              displayText: When creating a new AWS account, you will need to supply an email address that has never been used for an AWS account. We recommend you setup a distribution group email and give it a title following the convention of- “aws-management-account-primary@example.com”, which maps the email address to functionality. This allows the members of the distribution list to recover access to the environment, and if an individual leaves your company or organization, they can be removed from the distribution list. Only add a small number of members to the group email as this email address is for the management account root administrative user.

Additionally, identifying the locations where your AWS management plane and operational workloads are will help you ensure your accounts are not inconsistently sprawled across AWS.

        title: AWS Control Tower deployment and configuration
        description: AWS Control Tower is a managed service that orchestrates the deployment of resources to apply a consistent security configuration baseline across your AWS accounts and AWS environment. We recommend deploying AWS Control Tower as the orchestration tool to set up your initial AWS environment and apply post-deployment configurations.  During AWS Control Tower setup, you need to apply several parameters for deployment.

              displayText:  Before you deploy AWS Control Tower, we recommend that you collect and document the configuration parameters for your initial AWS Control Tower deployment (home region, operating regions, OU names, shared account names and unique email addresses). This will help ensure you adhere to the policies when setting up your environment on AWS and follow a naming convention from the start, allowing you to scale later on.

Tag policies can be configured to be Enforced which will disallow the creation of resources that do not adhere to the policy or Not Enforced which will allow you to audit the compliance of tags within your organization. It is helpful to start with a non-enforced tagging policy which will allow you to audit your environment. As your tagging program matures, you will want to move toward an enforced and possibly more granular tagging strategy.

This allows you to create a CloudWatch alarm based on log patterns in a CloudTrail CloudWatch Log group. Because Service Control Policies do not apply to the management account, it is important to configure alerting in the management account on unwanted events. A CloudWatch metric filter and alarm can be created to alert on root user logins to notify if the root user accesses the management account.

              displayText: When you use AWS Security Hub with an AWS Organizations organization, you can designate any account within the organization to be the Security Hub delegated administrator. Only the organization management account can designate Security Hub delegated administrators.  It is a best practice to delegate AWS Security Hub outside of the management account.  It is recommended to delegate Security Hub to the Security Tool account.
