The `Logging` directory contains various resources for provisioning and configuring centralizing logging within your AWS cloud environment. Please refer to the following table for a quick description of each solution within the directory:

| Example | Description | Type |
| --------------- | ----------- | ---- |
| [centralized logging CloudTrail S3 Bucket](./centralized-logging-cloudtrail-s3-bucket/) | Template creates an S3 Bucket to be deployed in your log archive account for centralized logging of CloudTrail. | [CloudFormation](./centralized-logging-cloudtrail-s3-bucket/cfn-centralized-logging-cloudtrail-s3-bucket.yaml), [Bucket Policy](./centralized-logging-cloudtrail-s3-bucket/s3-bucket-policy-centralized-logging-cloudtrail.json) |
| [centralized logging Config S3 Bucket](./centralized-logging-config-s3-bucket/)  | Template creates an S3 Bucket to be deployed in your log archive account for centralized logging of Config. | [CloudFormation](./centralized-logging-config-s3-bucket/cfn-centralized-logging-config-s3-bucket.yaml), [Bucket Policy](./centralized-logging-config-s3-bucket/s3-bucket-policy-centralized-logging-config.json) |
| [centralized logging KMS key Cloudtrail](./centralized-logging-kms-key-cloudtrail/) | Template creates a KMS Key to be deployed in your Security Tooling account for encrypting an Organizational CloudTrail Trail. | [CloudFormation](./centralized-logging-kms-key-cloudtrail/cfn-centralized-logging-kms-key-cloudtrail.yaml), [KMS Policy](./centralized-logging-kms-key-cloudtrail/kms-key-policy-for-org-cloudtrail.json) |
| [centralized logging KMS key Config](./centralized-logging-kms-key-config/) | Template creates a KMS Key to be deployed in your Security Tooling account for encrypting AWS Config Snapshots and History in the Log Archive account. | [CloudFormation](./centralized-logging-kms-key-config/cfn-centralized-logging-kms-key-config.yaml), [KMS Policy](./centralized-logging-kms-key-config/kms-key-policy-for-org-config.json)  |
| [centralized logging Org Trail CloudTrail](./centralized-logging-org-trail-cloudtrail/) | Template creates an Organization CloudTrail trail for management events and records them in a previously created centralized S3 bucket in the Log Archive account. | [CloudFormation](./centralized-logging-org-trail-cloudtrail/cfn-centralized-logging-org-trail-aws-cloudtrail.yaml) |
