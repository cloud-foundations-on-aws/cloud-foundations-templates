# Logging

The `Logging` directory contains various resources for provisioning and configuring centralizing logging within your AWS cloud environment. Please refer to the following table for a quick description of each solution within the directory:

| Sample Solution | Description | Type |
| --------------- | ----------- | ---- |
| [centralized logging CloudTrail S3 Bucket](./cloudformation/centralized-logging-cloudtrail-s3-bucket/) | Template creates an S3 Bucket to be deployed in your log archive account for centralized logging of CloudTrail. | CloudFormation |
| [centralized logging Config S3 Bucket](./cloudformation/centralized-logging-config-s3-bucket/)  | Template creates an S3 Bucket to be deployed in your log archive account for centralized logging of Config. | CloudFormation |
| [centralized logging KMS key Cloudtrail](./cloudformation/centralized-logging-kms-key-cloudtrail/) | Template creates a KMS Key to be deployed in your Security Tooling account for encrypting an Organizational CloudTrail Trail. | CloudFormation |
| [centralized logging KMS key Config](./cloudformation/centralized-logging-kms-key-config/) | Template creates a KMS Key to be deployed in your Security Tooling account for encrypting AWS Config Snapshots and History in the Log Archive account. | CloudFormation |
| [centralized logging Org Trail CloudTrail](./cloudformation/centralized-logging-org-trail-cloudtrail/) | Template creates an Organization CloudTrail trail for management events and records them in a previously created centralized S3 bucket in the Log Archive account. | CloudFormation |
| [KMS key policy for Org Cloudtrail](./kms-policies/kms-key-policy-for-org-cloudtrail/)| KMS key policy to encrypt CloudTrail within a multi account environment. | KMS Policy |
| [KMS key policy for Org Config](./kms-policies/kms-key-policy-for-org-config/)| KMS key policy to encrypt Config within a multi account environment. | KMS Policy |
| [Centralized logging CloudTrail S3 Bucket policy](./s3-bucket-policies/centralized-logging-cloudtrail-s3-bucket-policy/) | S3 Bucket policy that allows AWS Organization CloudTrail trail to write to the bucket. | S3 Bucket Policy |
| [Centralized logging Config S3 Bucket policy](./s3-bucket-policies/centralized-logging-config-s3-bucket-policy/) | S3 Bucket policy that allows Config recorders within an AWS Organization to write to the bucket. | S3 Bucket Policy |

## What is Centralized Logging?

Centralized logging in the cloud refers to a process of collecting and storing log data from various cloud-based resources, such as virtual machines, containers, applications, and services, in a central location. This centralized location is typically a dedicated log management service or platform, which provides a single interface for monitoring and analyzing logs across multiple cloud environments.

Centralized logging is essential for cloud-based systems, as it helps to streamline troubleshooting and debugging processes, improve system performance, and ensure compliance with security and regulatory requirements. By consolidating log data from different sources into a centralized location, IT teams can quickly identify and resolve issues, detect security threats, and gain insights into system usage and behavior.

In addition, centralized logging can enable advanced analytics and machine learning techniques to be applied to log data, providing greater visibility into system performance and enabling predictive maintenance and other proactive measures to be taken. Overall, centralized logging is an important tool for managing cloud-based systems, providing a comprehensive view of system activity and enabling rapid response to issues and threats.
