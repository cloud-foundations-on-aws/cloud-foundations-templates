The `Logging` directory contains various resources for provisioning and configuring centralizing logging within your AWS cloud environment. Please refer to the following table for a quick description of each solution within the directory:

| Example | Description | Type |
| --------------- | ----------- | ---- |
| [centralized logging CloudTrail S3 Bucket](./centralized-logging-cloudtrail-s3-bucket/) | Template creates an S3 Bucket to be deployed in your log archive account for centralized logging of CloudTrail. | [CloudFormation](./centralized-logging-cloudtrail-s3-bucket/cfn-centralized-logging-cloudtrail-s3-bucket.yaml) |
| [centralized logging Config S3 Bucket](./centralized-logging-config-s3-bucket/)  | Template creates an S3 Bucket to be deployed in your log archive account for centralized logging of Config. | [CloudFormation](./centralized-logging-config-s3-bucket/cfn-centralized-logging-config-s3-bucket.yaml) |
| [centralized logging KMS key Cloudtrail](./centralized-logging-kms-key-cloudtrail/) | Template creates a KMS Key to be deployed in your Security Tooling account for encrypting an Organizational CloudTrail Trail. | [CloudFormation](./centralized-logging-kms-key-cloudtrail/cfn-centralized-logging-kms-key-cloudtrail.yaml) |
| [centralized logging KMS key Config](./centralized-logging-kms-key-config/) | Template creates a KMS Key to be deployed in your Security Tooling account for encrypting AWS Config Snapshots and History in the Log Archive account. | [CloudFormation](./centralized-logging-kms-key-config/cfn-centralized-logging-kms-key-config.yaml)  |
| [centralized logging Org Trail CloudTrail](./centralized-logging-org-trail-cloudtrail/) | Template creates an Organization CloudTrail trail for management events and records them in a previously created centralized S3 bucket in the Log Archive account. | [CloudFormation](./centralized-logging-org-trail-cloudtrail/cfn-centralized-logging-org-trail-aws-cloudtrail.yaml) |
| [KMS key policy for Org Cloudtrail](./kms-key-policy-for-org-cloudtrail/) | KMS key policy to encrypt CloudTrail within a multi account environment. | [KMS Policy](./kms-key-policy-for-org-cloudtrail/kms-key-policy-cloudtrail.json) |
| [KMS key policy for Org Config](./kms-key-policy-for-org-config/)| KMS key policy to encrypt Config within a multi account environment. | [KMS Policy](./kms-key-policy-for-org-config/kms-key-policy-config.json) |
| [Centralized logging CloudTrail S3 Bucket policy](./s3-bucket-policy-centralized-logging-cloudtrail/) | S3 Bucket policy that allows AWS Organization CloudTrail trail to write to the bucket. | [S3 Bucket Policy](./s3-bucket-policy-centralized-logging-cloudtrail/centralized-logging-cloudtrail-s3-bucket-policy.json) |
| [Centralized logging Config S3 Bucket policy](./s3-bucket-policy-centralized-logging-config/) | S3 Bucket policy that allows Config recorders within an AWS Organization to write to the bucket. | [S3 Bucket Policy](./s3-bucket-policy-centralized-logging-config/centralized-logging-config-s3-bucket-policy.json) |
