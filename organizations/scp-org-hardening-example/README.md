# Organization Hardening Example

The example here is a single SCP document that has combined SCP statements. The example takes the `deny org leave` statement, the `prevent resource sharing outside the organization` statement and the `prevent root user activity` statement combining it into a single document. You should combine your SCP statements as necessary and attach the single document to the appropriate OU.
