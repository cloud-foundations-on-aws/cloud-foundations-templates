# Service Control Policies

The directory houses a collection of Service Control Policies (SCPs) that facilitate the management of resource access within your AWS cloud foundation. By making use of these sample policies, you can gain valuable insights into the specific permissions needed to access or protect various AWS resources, as well as the extent of those permissions.
