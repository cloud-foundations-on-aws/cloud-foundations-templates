# Tagging CloudFormation templates

Inside the directory, you can find a collection of sample templates in CloudFormation that can assist you in deploying different components of your AWS cloud foundation relevant to tagging. The templates are grouped into solution directories, each of which includes documentation for implementing the corresponding solution. With these resources at your disposal, you can quickly and effectively deploy the necessary AWS resources to build and maintain a robust cloud infrastructure.
