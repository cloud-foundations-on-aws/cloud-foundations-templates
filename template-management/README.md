The following directory contains various templates, examples, policies, and scripts that can help you establish your foundational template management capability in your cloud environment.

## What is Template Management?

Template management in the cloud refers to the process of creating, managing and deploying cloud infrastructure as code using templates. Templates are files that describe the desired configuration of cloud resources, such as virtual machines, storage, and networks, and can be used to automate the creation and management of cloud infrastructure.

The benefits of using templates for cloud infrastructure management are many. First, templates provide a standardized and repeatable way to create and configure cloud resources, which can be easily scaled up or down as needed. This can help improve the consistency and reliability of infrastructure deployments, and reduce the risk of configuration errors and security vulnerabilities.

Templates also make it easier to manage complex cloud environments by enabling version control and change tracking. This helps ensure that all changes to the infrastructure are properly documented and can be rolled back if needed. Additionally, templates can be used to automate the deployment of cloud infrastructure, reducing the time and effort required to configure resources manually.

There are several tools available for template management in the cloud, including AWS CloudFormation, Azure Resource Manager, and Google Cloud Deployment Manager. These tools provide a range of features for creating, managing, and deploying cloud infrastructure templates, and can be used with a variety of programming languages and frameworks. Overall, template management is an important aspect of cloud infrastructure management that can help organizations save time, reduce costs, and improve operational efficiency.
